printk(9)		       Kernel Functions			     printk(9)

NAME
       printk - print messages to console log

SYNOPSIS
       #include <linux/kernel.h>

       int printk(const char*fmt, ...)

DESCRIPTION
       Print  a	 formatted message to the kernel console, much like the printf
       function of the stdio library. Normally, the message is written to  the
       physical	 console device of the computer, although this behavior can be
       changed with the register_console function. Messages are also stored in
       a message log book.

       The generated string may also start with a message priority code, which
       sets the priority of the message. The priority code strings are of  the
       form  <n>  where	 n  is	a  number from 0 - 7. The following macros are
       defined in the <linux/kernel.h> header file:

	      KERN_EMERG
		     System is unuseable

	      KERN_ALERT
		     Action must be taken immediately

	      KERN_CRIT
		     Critical conditions

	      KERN_ERR
		     Error conditions

	      KERN_WARNING
		     Warning conditions

	      KERN_NOTICE
		     Normal but significant condition

	      KERN_INFO
		     Informational

	      KERN_DEBUG
		     Debug-level messages

       For example

	    printk(KERN_NOTICE "Hello, world.\n");

       does the expected thing.

RETURN VALUE
       Returns the number of characters written to the log.

BUGS
       float and double formats are not supported. Floats and doubles  do  not
       belong inside the kernel anyhow.

       The  printk  implementation  protects  itself  from interruption, so in
       principle it can be used in interrupts handlers and critical  sections.
       However,	 there	are  no	 guarantees about the console function that is
       registered.
